# Barrick

Barrick app is actually a single page mockup built from a 'mobile first' responsive point of view. This website does not use any custom css such as Bootstrap, any themes, or any custom JavaScript frameworks other than jQuery. The main point of this app is to demonstrate my ability to create something completely custom. All responsive page is created and designed by me, and I only used one mockup page, which is what a user would see if he or she completely maximized the width.
